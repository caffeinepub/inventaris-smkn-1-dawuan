  "summary": "REQ-1 is fully implemented in frontend/src/pages/Login.tsx. The school logo is read from localStorage via getSettings(), displayed above the login form with a fallback to a static school logo image and then a School icon if the image fails to load. The implementation is consistent with Layout.tsx usage and does not alter login form functionality. No missing requirements or hallucinated features are detected.",
